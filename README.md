Introduction:

In the age of centralized social media platforms, concerns around privacy, data ownership, and censorship have become prominent. Decentralized Twitter seeks to address these issues by creating a social media platform on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures that all interactions are immutable, transparent, and resistant to censorship.

Features:


~Post Tweets: Users can post tweets that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

~View Tweets: All tweets are publicly accessible and can be viewed by anyone.

~Like Tweets: Users can like tweets, with likes being recorded on the blockchain.

~Follow Users: Users can follow other users, creating a decentralized network of connections.

~Immutable Records: All posts and interactions are immutable, ensuring data integrity.

Usage:

To interact with the Decentralized Twitter application, you can use a web interface or directly interact with the smart contracts using tools like Remix or Ethers.js.
